Allison and I are hoping to embark on a grand adventure exploring the all the various things quails can get up to. We hope you enjoy what we have coming.</br></br>Since we both currently work for tech companies, this comic is close to home for the two of us. Engineers in SF have it pretty good these days, but that still doesn't stop many of them from griping about their first world problems. I know I'm guilty of it, and most people at my company are. This is our not-at-all subtle jibe at life in the current tech center of the world.</br></br>Thanks.</br></br>PJJ",

It floated on the edge of my perception for a real long time, and I knew a lot of the random pop-culture bits from it long before I actually sat down and started watching it. Tribbles. Live long and prosper. KHAAAAAAN!</br></br>It wasn't until college that I started hanging out with real trekkies, and it wasn't until almost the end of college that I started my quest to sit down and watch all of Star Trek. I started with TNG, because while Kirk is a pop culture Olympian, Picard felt more like the kind of guy I would want as my commanding officer.</br></br>True confessions: I have not seen all of Star Trek. I have not even seen all of TNG. This makes me eminently unqualified to talk about Star Trek in any meaningful way, I feel. What I can say is what Star Trek means to me. And the biggest piece of that meaning, the one that I think a lot of fans agree with, is that Star Trek is a vision for the future we hope we get, and would happily work towards. Its the ideal of the world we want to live in.</br></br>Gabriel Quail, Capt., is a representative of his race's better future who must contend with our imperfect present. He's a bird on a mission, a mission we want to share with you.</br></br>Thanks,</br></br>PJJ",

It powers so much of the Western business world that it would be a tough choice deciding which would have the greater impact: If all the oil in the world were to suddenly disappear, or if there was not a single coffee bean left on Earth. Coffee, like tea and alcohol, can also be a great social elixir. I find myself scheduling coffee meetings more than any other kind of casual encounter, because its a concept almost everyone is familiar with. It makes perfect sense that a quail from beyond the stars would want to see what all the fuss was about, and Captain Gabriel Quail charges straight into the barista's den in today's comic.</br></br>I have almost gotten into a coffee habit at every job I've had, but somehow pulled back right before the edge. This wasn't intentional on my part, something would just interrupt the pattern and I never got back onto it. Posts like <a title=\"A year without caffeine, part one\" href=\"http://bryanalexander.org/2013/01/04/a-year-without-caffeine/\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> and <a title=\"A year without caffeine, part two\" href=\"http://bryanalexander.org/2013/01/06/a-year-without-caffeine-part-2/\" target=\"_blank\">it's sequel</a> make me pretty happy about that. Allison, the better half of this strip, drinks coffee regularly every morning, but is nowhere near extreme about it.</br></br>It would be amusing if Captain Quail had managed to get his hands on a cup of Joe. A hyper-kinetic quail sounds darned amusing, and may appear later in this series. Until then,</br></br>Thanks,</br></br>Philip",

        "post": "So both Allison and I are pretty big fans of Jim Butcher's <a title=\"The Dresden Files\" href=\"http://www.jim-butcher.com/books/dresden\" target=\"_blank\">Dresden Files</a>. They are really great reads, and I'm in the process of re-reading all of them right now. Well, I say in the process, but I actually just finished going through the run. Its amazing watching the main character, Harry Dresden, change over the course of the books. He gets more powerful, as you would expect a hero to do over time, but his reasons for why he does what he does also change.</br></br>I would argue that Dresden at the beginning of the series acts out of a desire to right the wrongs in the whole world. He has led a hard life already, has seen what the dark side looks like, and decides to use his wizardly might to overcome that darkness. As the series progresses, he continues to save the world, but does so out of an increasing motivation to save the people he loves.</br></br>Love is a powerful force. I'm not going to get much more sappy here, and I think the way Captain Quail is experiencing love in today's comic is a perfect example of one facet of the emotion. What's a space quail to do, alone on a strange planet, but try to mingle with the natives? And isn't it natural for his head to be turned by a smooth beak and gleaming feathers?</br></br>Thanks,</br></br>Philip",

In reality, making a comic is hard, and we're busy people. Allison and I work full-time jobs, and I've got more side projects going on than is healthy. (Shameless plug: check out <a title=\"This Is Not That Game\" href=\"http://www.thisisnotthatgame.com\" target=\"_blank\">This Is Not That Game</a>)</br></br>That being said, being passed over for food is still pretty damn stone cold. We've all gone through bad rejections and bad breakups, but I don't know anyone outside the internet who's actually been dumped for a piece of bread. Maybe its a bird thing.</br></br>On an unrelated note, we are possibly the last people on the internet to discover <a title=\"Welcome to Night Vale on iTunes\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/welcome-to-night-vale/id536258179\" target=\"_blank\">Welcome to Night Vale</a>. In case we aren't and you've never heard of it, go check it out. It's hilariously creepy so far, and worth a listen if you're into the same things we're into. I mean, you;re here, so you must be, right? In any case, you should give the show a chance, and push yourself past the first episode. Getting used to the format is part of the fun.</br></br>In other unrelated news, today is my birthday! You know what would be an awesome gift? If you were to share Quail Comics with all your friends, neighbors, and random people on the street. Even if you happen to read this post\u00a0<em>not</em> on my birthday, it would still make a great birthday gift. Thanking you in advance.</br></br>Thanks,</br></br>Philip",

Humdrive is, in my mind, reminiscent of the Spacing Guild Navigators from Dune, but there's probably a bit of TNG's Data in there as well. \u00a0The Spice must flow!\u00a0Humdrive is pretty advanced technology, although she's not quite showing it at the end of today's strip. If I were flying a spaceship full of birds, I would probably have trouble with glass surfaces myself.</br></br>I know I'm way late to the party here, but <a title=\"XCOM: Enemy Unknown\" href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/xcom-enemy-unknown/3030-37152/\" target=\"_blank\">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a> is a pretty awesome game. I've always had a soft spot for top-down turn based strategy games, and for single-player squad based games. I thought <a title=\"Dawn of War II - Giant Bomb\" href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/3030-21175/\" target=\"_blank\">Dawn of War II</a> was the pinnacle of that type of game, until I played XCOM. Taking a game engine traditionally reserved for first-person shooters (the Unreal engine), and using it for a strategy game is part of the brilliance, and allows for great in-motion cinematics as you command your squad.</br></br>As I've recently come into some birthday money, and some of it is in the form of Amazon gift cards, I've been thinking about what I should get myself for my birthday; being a geek, naturally my thoughts turned to technology. I'm in this weird position though, where there's not any tech that I really want (at least not in the 'ooh, shiny!' sense). So I'm looking instead for tech things that will be actually helpful to my life, and coming up surprisingly short. The <a title=\"Google Chromecast\" href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromecast/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Chromecast</a> comes closest, but I already have something that functions pretty well as a set-top box. I'm left in this weird position where I feel like some technological thing could help me in some way, but nothing I see seems good enough to spend my money on. Maybe there's an app for that.</br></br>Thanks,</br></br>Philip",

        "post": "In high school, when I reunited with my first mistress technology after a brief stint where I was wholly devoted to my first wife, reading, I was very much into hardware. I loved breaking apart and building up computers and electronics of all types, and would pore over PC Magazine and Maximum PC as though they were holy writ. I barely understood what was going behind the blinkenlights, but I knew I enjoyed making them dance.</br></br>For an impressionable youth with an inclination towards electronics, especially in they lived on the West coast in the 90s and early 2000s, there was a certain store that was Mecca, Shangri-La, a store to which no other store could possibly compare. Glancing at today's comic and <a title=\"Captain Quail 6 \u2013 Humdrive\" href=\"http://www.quailcomics.com/comic/captain-quail-6-humdrive/\" target=\"_blank\">our last post</a>, you may be able to tell which store I'm talking about. Both Allison and I can understand spending way more time than is healthy ogling electronics, even though both of us now work more in software than in hardware. (If you're not certain of the difference, hardware people make the boxes with screens all around us. Software people find pretty, hopefully useful things to put on those screens.)</br></br>Being in software means we're closer than most to the pulse of where main-stream technology is headed. Some of it is magical, some of it is terrifying, some of it is both. Its incredibly possible that we'll do a comic in the future where Captain Quail and his trusty crew have to deal with some of the issues that are getting more and more important in our world: issues like trust, privacy, and security.</br></br>Its also equally possible that we'll just keep trying to create the quail equivalent of this:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-ZYzvD1rJ8\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-ZYzv</a></br></br>Thanks,</br></br>Philip",

Even the most die-hard Trekkies I know have at least one episode they will admit (normally in private, after you get them pretty drunk) is not great. I especially think that the stories Groening and co. created were better when they were still on Fox. The restrictions that I'm sure the the network made them conform to possibly made them more creative. I can't find any great articles (feel free to leave one in the comments), but my experience has been that working with restrictions makes better art.</br></br>That said, there is one episode of the newer Futurama seasons that I find outrageously funny. \"All the Presidents' Heads\"\u00a0sends the Planet Express crew to the time of the American Revolution, and hilarity ensues. This episode also has one of the best running gags in the series, I feel: the people of the past view Bender, a robot from the future, as a piece of technology that can do everything their current technology can do. Bender is, over the course of the episode, referred to as a stove, a crockpot, and a cannon, and despite Bender's insistence that he's none of those things, he can perform all those functions.</br></br>When we expect sufficiently advanced technology to be magic, we also expect it to be able to do everything magically.</br></br>Poor Humdrive probably doesn't think she can serve as a USB stick full of cat pictures. She's hyper-advanced bird technology from beyond the stars! Its also amusing to imagine what a civilization of birds must think about cats.</br></br>Captain Quail and Humdrive will be returning to the final frontier soon enough, so stay tuned!</br></br>Thanks,</br></br>Philip</br></br>(P.S. Take a close look at the second panel today. Humdrive has better USB support than my MacBook.)",

What's surprising to me is that, given how much time I spend on the internet, I find very little content that I think has broad enough appeal to be reposted, either on the various social networks or this comic. Its been a red-letter weekend by that count, because here are two things that I think you should go watch. Preferably now.</br></br><a title=\"Be a MANN\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9-QaIvjtBw\" target=\"_blank\">Be a MANN</a></br></br><a title=\"Go!Robins! - Bath Time\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFXwU9gtu1A\" target=\"_blank\">Go!Robins! - Bath Time</a></br></br>That first video is awesome because there needs to be more Disney/TF2 Crossover in the world. The second video is awesome because it represents one of the promises of the internet, at least for Quail Comics: You are not alone. A lot of us are attracted to the internet by the promise that there are people and communities who care about what we care about, and do what we want to do. That being said, I never imagined there would be somebody ELSE making genre media homages using small woodland birds. Thank you, Internet. Thank you.</br></br>We saw The World's End last night. I really like Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost, et al. Shaun of the Dead is \u00a0funny, Hot Fuzz is hilarious and The World's End is... well done. I certainly laughed through it, and the action was kicked up yet another notch from Hot Fuzz. But there was something about the movie that rubbed me the wrong way. It may be because of alcoholism in my family, or the sense that we as human beings should aspire to overcome our baser natures rather than being free to indulge in them constantly or... bah. I'm getting crotchety.</br></br>The World's End is a really good film. I don't regret seeing it, and I will probably watch it many more times in the future. But Hot Fuzz is still the best in the trilogy, as far as I'm concerned. If you liked Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, you should go see it. If you didn't, but like buddy-films with lots of action and laughs, go see it. Simon Pegg is a really cool dude, by all accounts, and I'm happy to watch any movie he's in.</br></br>Administrivia: We're going to really try and post Tuesdays and Fridays regular. Please share with your friends, your followers, and your cat!</br></br>Well, this post is almost as full as Humdrive's bag from today's strip (see? I did link back to the comic), so I'm going to call that a wrap. See you Friday.</br></br>Thanks,</br></br>Philip",

        "post": "I have just returned from a trip through the central valley of California, visiting Yosemite and then returning over the course of two whirlwind days. I've made this trip a number of times, as I have family that lives near one of the entrances to Yosemite, but something struck me this trip that I don't think I would have thought had I not started writing regularly: \"Epic stories need epic spaces.\"</br></br>As I rode past miles and miles of mountains and fields, and looked out on a sky that seemed so much bigger than the sky in the sub/urban area where I live, I was struck by a sense of scale that I hadn't ever noticed before. I think the Western Genre draws us in partly because it normally happens in these wide open spaces, where the sheer size of the landscape seems to focus all your attention on the actions of a few characters. Its part of the reason why epic stories that happen in cities don't just happen in any old city. They happen in mega-cities. Metropolis. Gotham. New York. Cities that, real or fictional, operate like gravity wells in a narrative ecosystem, drawing all the action around them into them.</br></br>I also thought a second version of the thought above: \"Epic stories need epic spaces. And there is no more epic space than space.\" When we call space the 'Final Frontier', we aren't just expressing our desire to explore, we're harkening back to the Western stories that seemed bigger than life for generations from a previous century. Every action that happens in space is all the more significant because of the vastness its happening in. A single light in a pitch black room is the center of attention. Even a somewhat-cocky commanding officer getting thrashed in a sparring match with his subordinate feels bigger because its taking place in a tin can hurtling through the void.</br></br>Speaking of genres and tropes, I'm pretty sure the 'Superior officer passing off losing as letting the other guy win' predates written stories. Nobody wants to look foolish, especially Quail captains. Also, Skuak is shaping up to be a pretty excellent foil for Gabriel Quail, and this makes me happy more than I thought it would. Hopefully you share in our joy.</br></br>Thanks,</br></br>Philip",

        "post": "There are some stories and worlds that are well-springs of creativity. You dive into them, and you swim through grottoes full of magic, barely believing what you're seeing. Eventually you surface, and you try desperately to remember all you've taken in while you mentally prepare yourself for the next dive. You know that your creativity and imagination has been kicked up a notch just by exposure to these universes, of which there are few. Neil Gaiman's Sandman is one. I would argue the Bioshock series is another. It would be tempting to add Tolkien's work, but that is a universe which has been heavily mined by popular culture, and its hard to feel inspired by it. (Personal opinion here, feel free to disagree in the comments.)</br></br>Then, there's Brian K. Vaughn. I could wax poetical for days about Fables, but its his more recent series that is my current cave of wonders. \u00a0I'm talking about Saga. I tend to read comic series in trade paperback or graphic novel form, even when the original material first came out in single issues, so I have just finished the second Saga trade paperback. The first one blew my mind in terms of discussing social justice and civil rights in a new and novel way. The second book went off the chain, and its not going to come back any time soon.</br></br>This well-spring effect often manifests itself in me as a series of questions, usually uttered in my head in an awed tone of voice. (Yes, my inner voice has tones. I did theater as a child.) Their ship is a what? Magic works by knowing secrets? The planet is actually WHAT? Really? That's a ROBOT? Holy crap, THAT'S HIS EX?\u00a0I hope you pick up the books, and that you too find yourself struck by some of the same questions I had.</br></br>A lot of times, I think creators create by trying to well-spring in reverse; namely, they throw a bunch of things together and see what sticks. This is a perfectly valid way of creating, and is often the best way to try things when you're starting out. Sometimes, though, you get bad fusions. Like Andy Warhol and Stephany Meyer. Garth Brooks and 50 Cent. Japanese-Mexican-Italian. I'm pretty sure only that last one is real, or at least that last one is the only one I've heard about. And, if you particularly hate yourself, you can find that restaurant in the Bay Area, where Allison and I live and work. Maybe its a Quail delicacy.</br></br>Thanks,</br></br>Philip",

If someone had told me a decade ago that putting captions on pictures of animals would become one of the primary ways the Internet expresses itself, I probably would have refused to believe them. It seems like one of those fads that should have burned out within a year, and has continued on despite expectations.</br></br>Some semantics: pictures with overlaid with text in impact font are memes, but not all memes are pictures overlaid with text in impact font. Meme is just giving a word to something that has existed since there have been humans. I personally like the Reddit-inspired name Advice Animals for these lolcat derivatives, but using the word meme to describe only funny captioned pictures on the internet is kind of missing the point of the word.

Since we're just starting out in the world of possibility that surrounds this comic, we haven't quite decided how we're going to subdivide the what we have into logical groupings. Chapters? Seasons? By year?

This new site (which is still in beta but getting better all the time) has been built from the ground-up for this comic, but hopefully built in such a way that adding more comics will be easy. By building it ourselves, we get full control over what we can do with it, and hopefully provide some awesome experiences to our readers.</br></br>Please play around with it, and let us know of any problems or suggestions for feedback you might. We're always available at our twitter and facebook pages (see above the comic), and we're hoping to add better reader feedback soon. The new site isn't quite as up-to-date with comics as this current site, but it may be by the time you read this. (Definitely check out my current personal favorite new feature, the <a title=\"All Comics\" href=\"http://www.captainquail.com/comic/all\" target=\"_blank\">All Comics View</a>, where you can see all the comics on one page to help you catch up quickly.)</br></br>Hopefully we'll be moving over to the new site permanently soon, stay tuned!</br></br>Thanks,</br></br>Philip",

This should be fairly self-explanatory as we're both software engineers who make webcomics in our spare time.

The people who go and really get into it live in a headspace that has familiar geography to my own, and my brain takes a little time to recognize I'm in a safe space, a space I can let myself go more than usual.</br></br>Its also been my experience that going to historic faires and conventions is more fascinating if you grab all of geek culture by the horns and don't let go. For example, at the faire Allison and I saw someone who I swear was going for elf, but Allison thinks was trying for Romulan. Its amazing to me that two engineers making a webcomic about space opera and quails can be at a Renaissance faire and discuss whether another attendee was aping Star Trek of the Lord of the Rings. The geek community can be abrasive, offensive, and just plain weird, but it can also be magical, inclusive, and transformative.</br></br>Which one or set of the above adjectives apply to this comic is up to you the reader, but we hope you enjoy it and add it to your personal venn diagram of what you're into.</br></br>Thanks,</br></br>Philip</br></br>PS - You should go to the Norcal Ren Faire, especially if you've never been.

Beyond that, they have some of the most original and recognizable shirts I know. How recognizable? I got stopped by someone at Ren Faire who recognized the shirt I was wearing as being a Questionable Content shirt. (Yes, I do like owls). Fair warning: QC is a 'slice-of'life' comic, where the only non-realistic elements are some anthropomorphized computers.

(I still think you should give it a try, though)</br></br>In site news, this will probably be the last Captain Quail posted to this old site! When you come back Tuesday morning (you do check every Tuesday and Friday, right?) this quailcomics.com will be using the shiny new system we built. Hooray!</br></br>I think that does it for today. Have a great weekend!</br></br>Thanks,</br></br>Philip",

No matter how much time you spend thinking about social justice and trying to correct your own preconceived notions,  your subconscious can blindside you with some garbage ideas that are just <em>wrong</em>. My experience has been that its the times I think I have a handle on things and am pretty well adjusted that I am closest to being a bigot. </br></br>We are raised in bubbles, and the bubble is thickest when we first enter adulthood. By exposing ourselves to new ideas and other people's bubbles, we stretch our own, making the walls thinner and thinner. I'm not sure if the bubble you grew up in ever pops; I'm still growing. I do know that sometimes it seems like I've just traded one bubble for another. </br></br>There's been a lot of talk recently about the bubble that is Silicon Valley, although its possible that that talk is only being heard from inside the valley's bubble. Many articles and blog posts have lamented that the companies in the valley are only trying to solve the problems of the valley's elite inhabitants. There is, as far as I can see, some truth to this statement. We don't need the majority of the services that most valley startups are trying to create. </br></br>Its easy to fall into the trap of believing that your way is right, especially when most of those around you reflect your opinions. Captain Quail and the crew of the Egg Surprise think they're defending Earth from Raptor aggression, and based on the Raptors' actions they seem to be right. But I hope we get to dive into backstory a bit with some of these cultures, and see that nothing is truly black and white. Its a lesson I need to remind myself of constantly. </br></br>Thanks,</br></br>Philip",

The Advnetures of Captain Quail.</br></br>Yes. We have been listening to far, far too much Welcome to Night Vale. We've also been watching heist movies. Well, me moreso than Allison. I have a deep abiding love for heist movies, the Ocean's 11 series in particular. There's something so deeply satisfying about seeing a plan pulled off flawlessly. </br></br>We here at Quail Comics are deeply excited for a number of reasons. Two of those reasons will become clear in the coming weeks, and we're not going to talk about them quite yet. The source of excitement we will talk about is this: we're doing a pretty good job at keeping a regular posting schedule. Keeping a regular posting schedule for an extended period of time seems to be what makes or breaks a webcomic. Allison and I have both seen comics that got us really excited, and then died mysteriously when their creators just stopped posting. We hope you've been enjoying our regular updates, and that we can keep providing them to you for the foreseeable future. </br></br>Speaking of the world o' webcomics, the series we'd like to highlight this week is <a href=\"http://www.olympusoverdrive.com/\">Olympus Overdrive</a>. We are really big fans of pieces that remix old stories in new ways (like classic space opera stories done with Quails) and Olympus Overdrive hits that button for us. You could describe the comic as the Greek mythos seen through the lens of a modern Alternate Reality Game, but you would really only be scratching the surface. It has some echoes of Digimon and Death Note (at least for me) that make it a really enjoyable read. Also, the creators aren't afraid to break out of the traditional comic medium and mix-in some actual animation, which makes my new-media radar set up and take notice. We enjoy it, and hope you will too. </br></br>Stay tuned next week, where you'll hear about some exciting things we've got going over the next month, as well as the revelation of Captain Quail's master plan to beat the Raptors!</br></br>Good night, sweet listeners. Good night.</br></br>Philip",

We don't have a goal with how far we're going to take the series, but milestones like this make us just want to keep going. </br></br>We also have two very exciting weekends ahead of us. This weekend, we will be at <a href=\"http://www.krakencon.com/\">Kraken Con</a>! Kraken Con is a new fan con happening just South of San Francisco, and we hope it will take off. We won't have a booth, but we will be wearing official Captain Quail T-Shirts, and handing out free prints from the comic. What do these T-shirts look like? I'm glad you asked, because we're going to be showing pictures of the shirts, as well as telling you how you can win one, in Friday's post.</br></br>It's our plan to have a rollicking good time with our prints and our shirts this weekend at Kraken Con, but no plan survives contact with the enemy.

The first five people to get one hundred referrals will win a Captain Quail tshirt in their size, absolutely free! We'll even ship it to you. If you aren't one of the first five, still keep sending your codes!

The last panel of today's comic has been in the back of our minds for a while now, and this story arc gave us the opportunity to introduce the Egg Surprise's medical officer, and use a joke line that has had us cracking up. We hope other people find it funny, but we really don't know. (psst. you can use the comment field below this post to let us know what you think)</br></br>Along with geeky puns, we also love geeky cons. This weekend, this past Saturday to be exact, was KrakenCon, a brand new con that we were very pleased by. KrakenCon has a lot of the potential for fun of FanimeCon, without much of the included drama that has been building in recent years. (Although both cons suffer from sever disorganization of the ticketing and admission lines) Hopefully, KrakenCon will continue to grow, and we will have a stronger presence in the coming years. This year was more exploration for us, and we enjoyed meandering the halls in our tshirts and handing out micro-prints. </br></br>We've had enough requests for shirts that we are definitely looking into getting those available for sale, as well as being giveaways in our referral challenge. If you would like to be first in line when we're doing our first batch for sale, leave a comment or use that handy box to the right to let us know.</br></br>Thanks,</br></br>Philip</br></br>P.S.

Allison felt the same way. APE is magical, wonderful, fantastic. It shows off all that is best in creative endeavors, and lets you meet people who see the world through their own unique lenses, like you probably do. Last year, I wrote a <a href=\"http://darlingdork.com/ape_worth_a_thousand_words/\" target=\"_blank\">piece for Darling Dork about APE</a>. Everything I said there still holds true, with the added bonus this year that I got to connect with other creators as a creator.</p><p>APE gave us lots of material for our Webcomic O' the Week, and we're very much looking forward to sharing those on Fridays. The compliments we got on Allison's shirt design also lit a fire under my posterior to try and work out mass-printing and distribution so we can get these shirts in people's hands.

But they're both far enough way that you feel the teensiest bit wasteful driving out to them, just so you can buy things in bulk. I haven't worked out whether its cost-effective when you compare with gas prices, but I have worked out that Costco free samples are normally tasty. Also, enough of them as you're shopping makes an excellent substitute for lunch. Apparently Skuak has figured that out as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Unrelated, I really like the Fall and the Winter. I prefer cold weather to warm weather to begin with (anyone in Seattle or Vancouver hiring software engineers who write comics?) but the cooler seasons also seem to be the time when I am most productive on the things I really care about. Maybe its a holdover from my school days; a new school year starts in the Fall and I am optimistic about what potential it might have. Yes, I was one of those people who enjoyed school more often than not. Allison and I are also big readers, and cold weather is the perfect excuse to stay inside with a good book. Or stay inside and write. Or draw.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of things we write and draw, it would mean a ton to us if you shared this comic with your friends, real and digital. We have all the usual share buttons below the comic, and we'd probably be willing to send you mini-prints if you promise to hand them out. They look nifty!</p><p>Other people we like also write and draw things, and the Webcomic O' the Week for this week is <a href=\"http://www.bitemecomic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bite Me!</a> by Dylan Meconis. Dylan's put out a number of works over the years, and we'll probably talk about the others in the future, but Bite Me! is the one I've enjoyed most recently, and its the most appropriate with Halloween on the horizon. The comic follows the story of a revolutionary French tavern-wench who meets a darkly alluring man with very point teeth, and hilarity ensues from there.&nbsp;</p><p>That does it for this week.

        "post": "<p>I'm a really big fan of technology that makes my life easier. Any dull task that I can get a piece of software or robot to do for me sounds like a good thing. That said, often my favorite uses of life-easing technology are the ones they don't use in promotional videos. <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/413/\" target=\"_blank\">XKCD</a> does a Roomba-related strip that I still find pretty hilarious (especially 'import soul'. I want a python library with that name...). <a href=\"http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=704\" target=\"_blank\">Questionable Content</a> also does a great Roomba skit, with the added value of Marten being accused of bird-dogging by a robot.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not sure how to express an idea related to the one above, except to describe it as 'physical remixing'. How awesome would it be to take all the various electronics in your house and wire them into new and crazy machines? What if your Roomba could be wired into your router and follow you, so you always had perfect signal? This is trending into the category of crazy techno-hippie talk, but I believe in the Maker culture, and I wish I could wire all the physical and digital bits of my life together to suit me best.</p><p>Changing tack completely, I have deliberately carved out some time recently to actually play some video games. I've been meaning to do this for a while, and over the weekend fired up <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/anodyne/3030-41495/\" target=\"_blank\">Anodyne</a>, because it sounded interesting and was part of the latest <a href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Humble Bundle</a>. I'm not too far into it, so there's not much I can give away, but so far I'm really enjoying it. It's a classic-style pixel art rogue-like, with a fantastic soundtrack and some serious thought put into effects, animations, and flow. By the time you read this, the Humble Bundle will probably be over, but its still worth picking up at full price through your favorite game distribution system. If you have other games you think Allison or I should play, let us know in the comments!</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Philip</p>",

        "post": "<p>Halloween has the potential of being lots of fun. Allison has historically enjoyed the holiday, I'm more ambivalent. Halloween is tons of fun when you're a kid, but takes on a different flavor when you're an adult. Worrying about work the next day, or diabetes, or having to spend so much time and energy on a costume when you have so little free time to being with takes a smidgen of the fun away. Plus there's those people who take Halloween as an excuse to be the biggest asshats they can be.&nbsp;</p><p>All that being said, this is one of the first years in a while that I truly enjoyed Halloween. Maybe its because I had a costume that took almost zero effort, but got lots of notice. (I was a Sriracha bottle, courtesy of a green beanie and a red Sriracha t-shirt.) Maybe its because I was so damn excited about seeing today's comic. The crew of the Egg Surprise celebrates the strange human holiday of Halloween... in style.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of comics, its time for the Webcomic O' the Week! Since our social media posts asking for suggestions went woefully unnoticed, we're giving a shout-out to another APE 2013 discovery (for us) that I have just devoured: <a href=\"http://www.kick-girl.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mystery Babylon</a>. Mystery Babylon is on my list of new favorites for so many reasons. It features a leading female character that breaks female character stereotypes. The art is an enchanting mid-point between Anime and Western styles. And it has the best use of religious source material this side of Sinfest. Which hopefully won't put you off. The religious connection is used so delightfully (think the Bible as written by Marvel Comics) that it enhances rather than detracts. I look forward to seeing where the story goes, and hopefully meeting its creator again at future conventions.</p><p>That's it for this week. If you have suggestions for Webcomic O' the Week, don't hesitate to add them to the comments. Feel free to promote your own stuff as well!&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Philip</p>\r\n",

        "post": "<p>Wishing wells are a fascinating Western [citation needed?] tradition. I remember as a kid seeing all the money at the bottom of public water features, and wondering why people would do that. I think I was given some vague answer about granting wishes, but I've never been tempted to throw a penny in a fountain and see if all my dreams came true. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishing_well\" target=\"_blank\">This Wikipedia article</a> tries to explain some of the history of throwing money into perfectly good bodies of water, but the original sources they cite don't look the most up-to-date. The cynic in me suspects that now people throw coins into fountains because they've seen other people do it.&nbsp;</p><p>As I was writing the script for this comic, it did occur to me that most public pools and fountains donate any money they find to charity, or simply add it to their coffers if they are already a charity. While I think this is a phenomenal practice, part of me wants to believe that we are collectively funding visitors from a world of Space Quails.&nbsp;</p><p>Continuing with my ability to only play one game a week, this past weekend I played The Bard's Tale, a game I have thoroughly enjoyed. Its not a perfect game, by any stretch, but it is an almost perfect parody of the click-everywhere, hack-and-slash, Baldur's Gate RPG-style game. Its a game that looks like it was made in the late 90s / early 00s, and that actually works in the game's favor. It lets you remember what RPGs were really like only a handful of years ago, and then spends the rest of its time lampooning how bad those games could be. The quests are endless, and hilariously pointless. At one point, you stop picking up gold from kills because the narrator thinks it wouldn't make sense for a wolf to have the contents of a treasury and a small kitchen lining its intestines. While Bard's Tale can drag at certain points, the little moments of genuine, un-forced humor writing make up for it.&nbsp;</p><p>Is there a (cheap, preferably free) game you want our opinion on? Congrats! The comment fields are open, just for you!</p><p>See you Friday!</p><p>Philip</p>",

        "post": "<p>Art, and the desire to make art, is why this comic exists in the first place. Allison, who draws the comic, is far more talented at visual art than I will probably ever be. That doesn't stop me from wanting to create, to see my ideas come life, and I consider myself really lucky to be working with someone who has the same drive.&nbsp;</p><p>When I say I'm not much of an artist, I mean my visual artistic skill is somewhere on the order of Combes from today's strip. I can see the picture in my head that I want to create, but I don't have the skill and experience to create it. The best I can do is try to describe it with words, so words have become my artistic medium. Words and code, anyway. A brief digression: Code is, in many ways, the ultimate artistic experience for someone who lives in the world of words. I can write something in text, and wonderful images and experiences appear on a screen. That's a form of magic that I hope to emulate in my writing someday.</p><p>Speaking of art, this week's Webcomic o' the Week is <a href=\"http://avasdemon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ava's Demon</a>. Alison suggested the comic to me because of its incredibly striking art and coloring, and I fell under its spell almost immediately. The story being told is a rose of complexity; each time you peel back a layer you see more petals you didn't know were there. This can be a bit much to handle at certain times in the story, and I admit the comic almost lost me once or twice. A desire to see more of the gorgeous art in Ava's Demon carried me through, and I'm glad it did. I now feel fully immersed in the story, and can't wait to see what happens next.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have a comic you think we should talk about, or a game we should play, let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p><p>That's it for this week!

I'm not certain I've ever properly started, to be honest. I often make excuses about having no time, but the reality is it just hasn't been important enough to me yet. I'm not sure I have a story that I actually need told, at least told in novel format.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm pretty happy with how the story is going for The Adventures of Captain Quail, such as it is. We're really liking the pattern of story arc - a few single strips - story arc. We've got a story arc starting this Friday, and we're highlighting a character that deserves more screen time.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of screen time, we're 100% interested in getting feedback from our readers. I got a chance to talk to some of our readers over the weekend, and got some good honest feedback. The number one piece of feedback was that the <a href=\"http://www.captainquail.com/comic/captain-quail-29-scuba/\">Scuba comic</a> was awesome. The second piece of feedback was that our comics can be hit or miss. We think they're all pretty good, but we're biased, and some of them just aren't going to hit the mark. We're actually ok with this. It's less about producing perfection every time, and more about trying to make something good consistently.&nbsp;</p><p>I haven't had a bunch of time to play games over the past week, but I did get to watch Allison's friend play a whole crapton of <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/assassin-s-creed-iv-black-flag/3030-41518/\">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a>. It's been a few months since I've played a AAA title on the platform it was meant for. (I love my Mac, but some games just don't run well on the platform). First thoughts: this game is <i>gorgeous</i>. It has some of the best water and cloth effects I've ever seen. There's also that undefinable coolness quantity of being able to be a pirate, and do piratey things. Like blow up ships. And board ships. And plunder! Overall, it looks pretty damn good.</p><p>That does it for today. We're serious about hearing from you, so leave a comment or sign up for our email list (using that shiny subscribe button under the comic).</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Philip</p>\r\n",

        "post": "<p>Howdy. We've been running The Adventures of Captain Quail for four months and I've been wanting to talk about some of the tech that powers us for a while. This is the first of hopefully many posts on how we do what we do. Our grand hope is that other people, especially other online artists, will find this info useful.</p><p>Today I want to talk about the numbers. We keep track of everything we can think of on the site, and we're always trying to refine what data we collect and how we use it. (Disclaimer: we do use cookies and tracking software like Google Analytics, but only for internal use, and never with any personal data attached). One of the things we use Google Analytics to track is the number of people who visit our site. This helps us know what kind of audience we're reaching, and whether any advertising we do is effective.&nbsp;</p><p>We've done two things different over the past month that really affected our numbers, and which we think are interesting enough to talk about. 1) We launched a Facebook ad campaign. 2) We started posting to Reddit. We've been posting to Facebook and Twitter for months, but never to Reddit before last week. Specifically, we posted to <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/comics\" target=\"_blank\">/r/comics</a> and <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/webcomics\" target=\"_blank\">/r/webcomics</a>.</p><p>Here's our total visits chart for the past month:</p><p><img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"http://quailcomics.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/img/total-numbers.png\" style=\"\"><br></p><p>We don't have the greatest readership, currently, but we're still very new, and our monthly numbers are growing.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's a look just at the numbers over the time we ran the Facebook ad campaign:</p><p><img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"http://quailcomics.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/img/october-facebook.png\" style=\"\"><br></p><p>At the time, that Facebook campaign pushed us into higher numbers than we had ever seen. We're not made of money, unfortunately, so we had to let the campaign die, although we're planning to run more ad campaigns on Facebook in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>If you look at the picture of the total numbers for the past month, and compare it to the Facebook ad numbers, you can probably guess what's coming next. On a whim last week, I posted <a href=\"http://www.captainquail.com/comic/captain-quail-29-scuba/\" target=\"_blank\">Captain Quail 29</a> to <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/comics\" target=\"_blank\">/r/comics</a> and <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/webcomics\" target=\"_blank\">/r/webcomics</a>. I also posted Friday's and Tuesday's comic to those two subreddits on the days they came out. Here's those numbers:</p><p><img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"http://quailcomics.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/img/reddit-numbers.png\" style=\"\"><br></p><p>Holy cow! Far and away the best days we've ever had on the site (Neglecting some weird traffic from Switzerland a month ago we're still trying to figure out). In what may be the most obvious statement of the past few years, it seems that posting to Reddit can <b>really</b>&nbsp;increase your page views.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, not all page views are created equal. The quality of web traffic is really difficult to measure, and there will be a future post on how we're defining 'good' traffic. What was most interesting to me about these numbers, however, was the corresponding geography. Here's the map of all our visitors, prior to posting to Reddit:</p><p><img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"http://quailcomics.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/img/october-geography.png\" style=\"\"><br></p><p>Here's the map <i>after</i>&nbsp;posting to Reddit:</p><p><img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"http://quailcomics.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/img/reddit-geography.png\" style=\"\"><br></p><p>We've got people from all over the world who have seen our comic. That. Is. So. Cool.</p><p>Of course, these are not equal comparisons, by any stretch. Our Facebook ad was targeted at the US, and Reddit is known for having visitors from all over the world. And, like I mentioned above, views from Reddit and views from Facebook may be apples and oranges. But for sheer <i>reach</i>, it seems like Reddit is a crazy-powerful network.</p><p>Interestingly enough, the hit numbers from Reddit are more disproportionate than I would've guessed to the participation numbers - that is, people who upvote or downvote. Here's the numbers on the votes the three comic postings have received:</p><p><img src=\"http://quailcomics.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/img/reddit-post-1.png\" style=\"width: 203.55633802816902px; height: 123px;\"><img src=\"http://quailcomics.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/img/reddit-post-2.png\" style=\"line-height: 1.45em; width: 187.8832116788321px; height: 110px;\"><img src=\"http://quailcomics.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/img/reddit-post-3.png\" style=\"width: 202.27678571428572px; height: 115px;\"><br></p><p>We didn't pay for upvotes, obviously, and one of our comics even got more downvotes than upvotes. But that day's posting also resulted in the <i>most</i>&nbsp;hits!</p><p>This article isn't breaking any new ground, but I think its awesome to put some numbers behind the 'gut feeling' that you should always post your content to Reddit. If you also find this interesting, or think we did this all wrong, or just want to discuss this, leave a note in the comments below. If you're as crazy as we are, and want to explore what happens you apply modern tech startup practices to the world of digital art, send us an email: captainquail@inkpebble.com.</p><p>Thanks, and look for the next installment of Quail Tech!</p>\r\n",

I'd like to believe that our plots are slightly more feasible than the average Original Series plot, but science fiction should always be pushing the bounds of what's real and unreal. Today's strip begins a story arc that is quintessential Star Trek: Something On The Ship Is Wrong. I'm feel very inexperienced on the whole concept of writing a story in a serial format, and while I hope the next strips will be interesting, I'm not sure I'll know how I feel about it until its done. I'm hoping others will give me feedback as the story progresses.&nbsp;</p><p>You might have missed it, but yesterday we added a blog <a href=\"http://www.captainquail.com/post/quail-tech-a-look-at-the-numbers/\">post about some of our analytics numbers</a></a>. Allison and I both work for startups, and we want to bring some of the things startup do well into the world of digital art, especially webcomics. In this instance, that means keeping track of data for everything we can think of, and seeing what those numbers can tell us. We invite you to read the post, and let us know if there's other topics related to running a webcomic you'd like us to write about.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking about the wonderful world of webcomics brings us to our Webcomic O' the Week. This week we'd like to highlight <a href=\"http://plumecomic.com/\">Plume</a>, one of the more fully-formed comics we've come across. The story of this fantasy-Western cross is well-written, and the art grabbed me almost immediately. Plume's use of lighting is something I think a lot of artists aspire to; it draws the eye exactly where the artist wants. As I was reading through the current pages (the comic is still ongoing) I got this fantastic Firefly-meets-Anastasia feeling that I think will resonate with a fair number of the people who read Captain Quail.</p><p>That wraps it up for this week, unless you're one of our email subscribers.

We also try to have those things known as lives, hanging out with friends and loved ones. I spend almost all of my free time working on making this site, and the experience of Captain Quail, better. The experience is somewhat akin to how it must feel to operate that super-cool, but also super-difficult-looking, science-mo-tron in today's comic. So these blog posts are a source of dread and joy in equal measure.&nbsp;</p><p>The dread comes from the dread that I think all creators with a deadline face: \"Oh lord. I have to create something, and I have to create it before the deadline I've set for myself, or I'll upset my fans! I have no time, and the list of things I think I should do is a mile long.\" Really, I'll just be upsetting myself, because I'll breaking a promise to myself, the promise of keeping a regular comic schedule.&nbsp;</p><p>The joy comes from the actual act of creating. I love writing, I enjoy putting my thoughts down on this 21st-century paper, I feel giddy over being able to share those thoughts with anyone who will listen. I would argue a lot of other people, even people who don't think of themselves as creative, feel the same way. There's also the fact that, on the list of things I 'should' be doing in relation to this site, the act of creation is always at the top. We're creating this comic and building this site because we love to create, and we should be optimizing for creating above all else. Somedays we're better at that, somedays we're worse.&nbsp;</p><p>Returning to our regular Tuesday schedule, here's Philip's review of a game I have been playing in what little spare time I have: Tiny Death Star! If you played the original <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/tiny-tower/3030-35773/\">Tiny Tower</a>&nbsp;and didn't like it much, then there's nothing to see here, move along. Tiny Death Star is the same management sim for mobile devices that Tiny Tower was, only re-themed with everything Star Wars they could think to cram in. All the same mechanics that you loved or hated are still there, with one exception that I think makes the game more playable. In the original, you had to move characters to the correct floor using the elevator. They almost never went away, and you couldn't get any other characters in the elevator until they were gone. Now, you can take them to Imperial levels, and imagine that you're sending annoying digital people to be interrogated by Imperial officers. Way more fun. At the end of the day, you're either going to love or hate Tiny Death Star, despite the new skins, almost entirely dependent on whether you like that kind of game. I keep playing because I'm masochistic, I think.&nbsp;</p><p>That's another Tuesday, all wrapped up for you. We're still taking suggestions for games we should review in the comments below (thanks random guy who suggested Farming Simulator!) and we'll be back Friday.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Philip</p>",

Right?</p><p>Steampunk is a fascinating sub-genre of Science Fiction that is much more firmly in the camp of Science Fantasy, and I think it is in many ways a response to feeling cheated about the future. The century we're living in now is the future that's been promised for decades. The problem is that for so many people it doesn't <i>feel</i>&nbsp;any better. There's an implicit promise that I think draws people to steampunk, beyond its obvious coolness. The promise is that if the past were a magical place filled with wonderful technology, then the future, our present, would be so much better than it is now.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, that probably wouldn't be the case at all, and the best steampunk deals with how real humans would react to fantastical situations in Victorian times. One webcomic that stands out, which is our Webcomic O' the Week for this week, is <a href=\"http://bostonmetaphysicalsociety.com/\">Boston Metaphysical Society</a>. This is a webcomic we discovered at APE, and so far its one of the better steampunk webcomics I've read. Its also a comic that I have read that Allison has not (yet), so the opinions here are all my own. The elevator pitch is that Boston Metaphysical Society follows a group of adventurers around New England as they attempt to get a handle on all the supernatural weirdness that seems to continually plague the American North East (I blame Lovecraft). I could go on and on about the little bits hidden in the work that I like (Thomas Edison vs Harry Houdini - FIGHT!), but I'm hoping you'll explore it on your own. If you like steampunk or paranormal investigation stories, Boston Metaphysical Society might just tickle your fancy.</p><p>If you would like us to feature a webcomic, or you just want to tell us how great/awful we're doing, leave a comment below. That's it for this week, see you on Tuesday for the continuing Adventures of Captain Quail!</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Philip</p>",

        "post": "<p>For those of you who, like us, celebrate the American Holiday of Thanksgiving, Happy Thanksgiving Week! For the rest of you, welcome to the week where its impossible to get Americans to do pretty much anything. Lucky for you, we are dedicated to providing high-quality content year-round here at The Adventures of Captain Quail, so we will have a post today (obviously) and Friday!&nbsp;</p><p>Continuing the series of Philip Reviews Video Games, I've been playing lots of <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/assassins-creed-iii/3030-37494/\">Assassin's Creed III</a>, mostly so that I can have some glimmer of a story background for playing Assassin's Creed IV. I'm not... positive I like the game. I like parts. Most of the mechanics are amusing, although I find the running-jumping-parkouring a little finicky. Honestly the mechanic I found the most fun was the ship captaining, which is part of the reason I'm so excited to get to the fourth game. Allison, on the other hand, really did <i>not</i>&nbsp;like the ship parts of the third game, and likes the parkour-through-the-revolutionary-forest way more than I did. While I don't want to hate-fest on the game too much, I also don't sympathize with the main character much. Connor feels a little one-dimensional to me, and not in the cool Batman-y way. Haytham, the game's villain, seems like a much more well-rounded character, which may indicate more about me than the game. ...I'm going to stop talking about that now. Overall, I'm excited to see where the game goes, and I'm super excited to play the next one.</p><p>That's about it for this pre-Thanksgiving Tuesday. I'm actually looking forward to this Thanksgiving quite a bit, and I hope all you are as well. Unless you're not American. Or don't celebrate Thanksgiving. In which case, just have a fantastic week! See you Friday.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Philip</p>",

I also can't properly express my gratitude for the artists and creators we have talked to, both online and at APE, that have been filled with support and well-wishes. I could never list all of them, but I hope we can give back by featuring them on this site, and pay it forward by helping the next generation of aspiring artists.</p><p>That's it for this week.
